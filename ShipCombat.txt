Ship Stats

Upgrade your ship to improve its stats

- Drive System = Evasion
- Processor = Targeting
- Scanner = Allows you to see what their next move is going to be, and what weapon they're powering up

Upgrading these systems can improve your odds when it comes to ship to ship combat

- CombatGen

- set enemy stats
- randomise who's turn it is first

- take turn
- coroutine to wait for x seconds until action is complete
- repeat

- attack

- select random tile on target ship
- if ship targeting + random > enemy evasion + random
	- fire weapon at target, flag projectile willHit = true
- else
	- fire weapon at target, flag projectile willHit = false
- end turn

-------------------------------

Simple Strategy comes in deciding what weapon to use, whether to evade and whether to flee
If you can see that they're about to flee, you can use your Tether Launcher to grapple onto them preventing their escape
If you can see they're about to launch a missile barrage, you can engage your PDCs to evade the missile

Attack
	- Select Weapon
	- Select Target (Click a tile)
	- Fire
		- On Collision
			- Calculate if it hits
			- if it hits
				- explode
				- enemyHp -1
			- else
				- keep going
			-endif
